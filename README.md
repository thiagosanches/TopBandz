# top-bandz
A card game based on [TopTrumps](https://toptrumps.us/). Right now, we have just one attribute to play against it, which is the date of birthday of an artist or the begin date of a band. The front-end application is using vue.js. The back-end API you can find [here](https://github.com/musictrumps/music-trumps), it was built using .NET core 3.1.
